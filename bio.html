	<p>
	Caroline McBrien is originally from Long Island, New York, but now lives in Boston and attends school at Tufts University. There, she is a Senior studying Computer Science, and has become particularly interested in the way technology is used in politics. She is also involved in the Tufts Mock Trial team, which has fueled her interest in debate and the law.  You can usually find her at the Tufts WMFO radio station, where she has her own radio show, hiking in the White Mountains of New Hamshire, or biking through the streets of Boston.
